# Momentum-Clonish
A subtle clone of Momentum chrome extension. A
[Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca)
clone made with Next.JS and Typescript.
Originally a
[vanilla Javascript project](https://github.com/librity/nc_nomentum)
with less features.

I personally use this and will be adding more useful features in the near future.
I'm committed to online privacy and anonymity, and this app will:

- Never save any personal data.
- Never use or save cookies.
- Never use any resources that push trackers (like google fonts).
